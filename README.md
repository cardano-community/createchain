## Create Cardano Network from scratch

This repo is a reference script material that was created using [IO's documentation](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/f37a19902598da1b23b689196cada10d08da9f92/docs/reference/create-cardano.md) and [mkfiles script](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/scripts/babbage/mkfiles.sh) to create network from scratch.

> The state of the files might seem a bit wonky, as the initial state of script was used for creation of guildnet and files were modified ad-hoc as required, rather than a perma-state, but should be simple once gotten used to, to submit forks post shelley. There is ample of scope to improve these scripts, but we always ended up spending few mins here and there to apply updates on short timeframes. Hopefully, we can find the time at some point to collaborate and improve the scripts here
